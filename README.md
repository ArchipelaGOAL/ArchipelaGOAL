## üìÇ File Structure

### **Archipelago-specific files:**

```
goal_src/jak2/pc/features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archipelago.gc       # Main AP autosplitter/tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ap-struct.gc        # AP item reception & mission checking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ap-struct-h.gc      # AP structure definitions
```

### **Modified core files:**

- `task-control.gc` - Mission completion hooks
- `game-task.gc` - Task system modifications
- `warp-gate.gc` - Area transition logic
- Various level-specific scene and obs files

## üöÄ Entry Points

### 1. **Memory Interface** (Version 1)

- Struct at `*ap-info-jak2*` contains all tracking data
- Version field ensures compatibility with AP client
- End marker "end" for memory boundary detection

### 2. **Mission Completion Hook**

- Integrated into `task-control.gc`
- Automatically calls `ap-mission-checked!` on task completion
- Tracks both main and side missions

### 3. **Item Reception**

- `ap-item-received!` function processes incoming items
- Spawns appropriate talkers with confirmation messages
- Adds items to inventory using game-task-node commands

## üéÆ Usage

This mod is designed to work with the Archipelago multiworld system:

1. **Game Communication**: The game communicates with an external Archipelago client via shared memory
2. **Mission Tracking**: Mission completions are automatically tracked and sent to the AP server
3. **Item Reception**: Items from other worlds are received and integrated into the game
4. **Progressive Unlocks**: City areas and content unlock based on received items rather than normal progression

## üîß Technical Details

- **Memory Version**: 2 (must match `expected_memory_version` in MemoryReader.py of Archipelago)
- **Mission Capacity**: 70 main missions, 24 side missions
- **Shared Memory Structure**: Uses arrays for tracking checked missions
- **Item Integration**: Uses existing game-task-node-command system for adding items
- **Talker System**: Each item spawns a talker with appropriate dialogue

## üìà Development Progress

### Accomplished Tasks

- [x] Complete mission tree segmentation system
- [x] All items have corresponding UI elements
- [x] Side mission and collectible tracking implementation
- [x] Extensive bug fixes for mission logic across all levels
- [x] Proper talker spawns for all receivable items
- [x] Debug information system for tracking AP checks

### Known Areas of Work

- Collectibles (orbs, skull gems) tracking integration
- Further refinement of mission dependencies
- Additional route logic for late-game areas(?)

## üîó Integration with Archipelago

This mod allows Jak 2 to participate in Archipelago multiworld randomizers. Players can:

- Send Jak 2 mission completions as checks to other worlds
- Receive items from other games that unlock Jak 2 content
- Experience a randomized progression through Haven City
- Play cooperatively with friends in other games

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Mod
